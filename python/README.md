# Overview

This repository contains a simple C++ program, `main.py`, designed to interface with an exploreHD camera and display the MJPEG frames from the camera in a window. This README file provides instructions on how to run the application.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- Python (version 3.x)
- OpenCV library (`cv2`)

## Running the Application

You can run the application by executing the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will launch the program, which will attempt to connect to the exploreHD camera and display the MJPEG frames in a window.

## Configuration

If you have specific configuration requirements, you can modify the relevant parameters in the `main.py` file. Look for comments or constants related to camera settings and adjust them accordingly.
